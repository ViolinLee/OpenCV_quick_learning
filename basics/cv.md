# CV Theory
Computer Vision Builds On Image Processing and Machine Learning.   
Fundamentals of Computer Vision:   
1. Geometry:How to relate world coordinates and image coordinates   
2. Matching:How to measure the similarity of two regions   
3. Alignment:How to align points/patches; How to recover transformation parameters based on matched points   
4. Grouping:What points/regions/lines belong together?   
5. Categorization/Recognition:What similarites are important?
